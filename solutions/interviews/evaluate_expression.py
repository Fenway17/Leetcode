# Evaluate Mathematical Expression Without Libraries

# Description:
# Write a function that takes a string `expression` containing a math problem and calculates the result. 
# The math problem may have:
# - Whole numbers (like 1, 42, etc.).
# - The `+` and `-` operators for addition and subtraction.
# - Parentheses `(` and `)` to control the order of operations.
# - Spaces (you can ignore them).

# You **cannot** use Pythonâ€™s `eval()` function or any similar library.

# ---

# Examples:
# Example 1:
#     Input: 
#     expression = "4 + 5 - (9 + 1 - (5 + 5 - (4 - 3))) + 6"
#     Output: 6

# Example 2:
#     Input: 
#     expression = "(1 + (2 - (3 + 4)))"
#     Output: -4

# Example 3:
#     Input: 
#     expression = "10 - (2 + 3) + 5"
#     Output: 10
